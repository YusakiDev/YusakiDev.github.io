            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm Puree Pangma, a 22-year-old game development enthusiast from Thailand. I'm currently studying Game Development at Bangkok University, where I'm honing my skills in creating immersive gaming experiences.</p>
            <p>My passion lies in both the technical and creative aspects of game development. I'm particularly interested in:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>2D and 3D game design</li>
                <li>Game mechanics and systems</li>
                <li>Project management in game development</li>
                <li>Community building through multiplayer experiences</li>
            </ul>
            <p>When I'm not coding or designing games, I enjoy playing and analyzing various game genres to understand what makes them engaging and fun. This hobby not only entertains me but also contributes to my growth as a game developer.</p>
